# Backup and Disaster Recovery Guide

## Overview

The Stoneclough PWA implements a comprehensive backup and disaster recovery system to ensure data protection and business continuity.

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups

**Daily Full Backups**
- Scheduled via Vercel Cron Jobs at 3:00 AM UTC
- Includes all application data
- Compressed and encrypted
- 30-day retention period
- Automatic verification after completion

**Backup Components**
- User profiles and authentication data
- Community posts and responses
- Events and attendee information
- Business directory entries and reviews
- Job postings and applications
- Environmental initiatives
- Prayer requests and responses
- Organizational structure data
- System configuration and metadata

### Backup Types

1. **Full Backup**
   - Complete snapshot of all data
   - Performed daily
   - Used for complete system recovery

2. **Incremental Backup** (Future Enhancement)
   - Only changes since last backup
   - Faster and smaller
   - Requires full backup as base

3. **Differential Backup** (Future Enhancement)
   - Changes since last full backup
   - Balance between speed and completeness

### Storage and Security

**Encryption**
- All backups encrypted using AES-256
- Encryption keys stored securely
- Separate key management system

**Storage Locations**
- Primary: Cloud storage (AWS S3/Google Cloud)
- Secondary: Geographic redundancy
- Local: Emergency offline copies

**Access Control**
- Admin-only access to backup systems
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Audit logging for all backup operations

## Disaster Recovery Procedures

### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

- **Critical Systems**: 1 hour
- **Full Application**: 4 hours
- **Complete Data Restore**: 8 hours

### Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

- **Maximum Data Loss**: 24 hours
- **Typical Data Loss**: 1 hour (with incremental backups)

### Incident Classification

**Severity Levels**

1. **Critical**
   - Complete system failure
   - Data corruption affecting multiple tables
   - Security breach with data compromise

2. **High**
   - Partial system failure
   - Single table corruption
   - Performance degradation > 50%

3. **Medium**
   - Feature-specific issues
   - Minor data inconsistencies
   - Performance degradation < 50%

4. **Low**
   - Cosmetic issues
   - Non-critical feature problems
   - Minor performance issues

### Recovery Procedures

#### 1. Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)

**Assessment**
- Identify scope and severity of incident
- Determine affected systems and data
- Estimate user impact

**Communication**
- Notify incident response team
- Update status page
- Prepare user communications

**Containment**
- Isolate affected systems
- Prevent further damage
- Preserve evidence for analysis

#### 2. Recovery Planning (15-60 minutes)

**Backup Selection**
- Identify most recent valid backup
- Verify backup integrity
- Calculate recovery time estimate

**Resource Allocation**
- Assign recovery team members
- Prepare recovery environment
- Coordinate with external services

**Stakeholder Communication**
- Notify leadership team
- Update users on expected timeline
- Coordinate with support team

#### 3. Data Recovery (1-8 hours)

**Environment Preparation**
- Set up recovery environment
- Verify system dependencies
- Prepare database connections

**Data Restoration**
- Restore from selected backup
- Verify data integrity
- Test critical functionality

**System Validation**
- Run automated tests
- Perform manual verification
- Check data consistency

#### 4. Service Restoration (Final 1-2 hours)

**Gradual Rollout**
- Enable read-only mode first
- Test with limited users
- Full service restoration

**Monitoring**
- Enhanced monitoring during recovery
- Performance validation
- Error rate monitoring

**Documentation**
- Record recovery actions
- Update incident log
- Prepare post-mortem

### Manual Recovery Commands

#### Database Restore

```bash
# List available backups
curl -X GET /api/admin/backups

# Verify backup integrity
curl -X POST /api/admin/backups/{id}/verify

# Restore from backup (dry run)
curl -X POST /api/admin/backups/{id}/restore \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"dryRun": true}'

# Perform actual restore
curl -X POST /api/admin/backups/{id}/restore \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tables": ["profiles", "events"]}'
```

#### System Health Check

```bash
# Check system status
curl -X GET /api/health

# Check database connectivity
curl -X GET /api/health/database

# Check external services
curl -X GET /api/health/services
```
