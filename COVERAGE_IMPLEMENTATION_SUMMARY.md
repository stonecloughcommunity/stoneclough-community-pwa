## 🔧 Configuration Highlights

### Environment-Specific Thresholds

#### Development (60% target)
- Encourages testing during development
- Lower barriers to entry

#### Test Environment (80% target)
- Standard production-ready thresholds
- Security files: 95%
- Auth files: 90%
- Components: 75%

#### CI/Production (80-85% target)
- Strict enforcement
- Security files: 95-98%
- Critical path coverage validation

### File Categories

#### Security-Critical (95% required)
- `lib/auth/**/*`
- `lib/security/**/*`
- `components/auth/**/*`
- `middleware.ts`

#### Performance-Critical (85% required)
- `lib/database/**/*`
- `lib/cache/**/*`
- `hooks/use-*`
- `components/ui/**/*`

## 📈 GitHub Actions Workflow

### Triggers
- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests to main/develop
- Daily scheduled runs (6 AM UTC)
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Features
